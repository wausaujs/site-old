We are going to jump back into building the wausaujs.org progressive web app (PWA). I want to try getting everyone into the code at the same time so we can all contribute during the meeting.

We decided a few meetings back that we would build it without a framework in vanilla js and use Firebase as the back end. We still have to decide how we want to store and render the meetings and RSVPs etc.

See you there.
